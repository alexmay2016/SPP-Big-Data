\section*{Summary}
%\subsection{Summary}

The security of cryptographic protocols is related via reductions to the security of presumably hard problems. Such a reduction transforms any successful adversary against a protocol into one against the underlying problem such that, vice versa, the hardness of the problem implies the hardness of the protocol. In the past, cryptographers used classical number-theoretic problems like the RSA problem or the discrete logarithm problem. But these problems will become insecure once quantum computers become real. It is therefore no surprise that
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a call for quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives in autumn 2016.

Most likely, the majority of reasonable candidates for the NIST competition will be based on hard problems from coding theory and lattices, such as Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). NIST requests well-defined security levels of 128, 192 and 256 bits classically, and 64, 80, 128 bits quantumly. This means that for instantiating LPN with, say, 128 bit classical security, one has to make sure that any algorithm for LPN will need at least $2^{128}$ steps on a classical computer. 

Since running times of $2^{128}$ escape current computational power,
one nowadays typically studies medium security levels of $50-60$ bits in practical experiments, and then extrapolates via asymptotic formulas to the desired security level to make a reasonable security claim. However, besides running time, the memory requirement is a major factor. In fact, for the interesting problems LPN and LWE current algorithms also require to store an exponential number of samples. This huge amount of data and its storage requirement do not allow to run experiments even for medium security levels, and thus prevent a reliable prediction of cryptographically secure key sizes.

%\marc{das koennte noch 1-2 Saetze laenger sein:}
The current project studies low-memory algorithms for problems in coding and lattice theory, and how this translates to the case when these problems are deployed in one of the prevailing applications of modern cryptography, namely, key exchange protocols.

The security of cryptographic protocols is related via reductions to the security of hard problems.
A cryptographic security proof states that any successful adversary that breaks a cryptographic protocol $\Pi$ in time $t$ can be translated into an algorithm that breaks a hard problem in time $t'$. In order to instantiate cryptographic protocols $\Pi$ efficiently, one has to first find a tight security proof that closely links $\Pi$ to a hard problem, i.e. a reduction for which $t'$ is not much larger than $t$. Second, one has to make sure that any algorithm for the hard problem runs in time larger than $t'$. 

In the past, cryptography relied on well studied hard problems from number-theory, such as factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in elliptic curves. However, these problems stay no longer hard in the presence of quantum computers. Therefore, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) announced in autumn 2016 a call for Post-Quantum cryptographic primitives.
%, i.e. encryption, signature and key exchange. Candidates have to be submitted by Nov 2017 and then undergo a period of 3-5 of cryptanalytic research.

However, current algorithms for LPN and LWE for security level $b$ also require to store $2^b$ samples. This huge amount of data prevents to run experiments even for medium security levels, and thus prevents a reliable prediction of cryptographically secure key sizes.

%Thus, we require data structures for encrypted data. In addition, we have to make sure that there do not exist any built-in backdoors for cryptography that allow an illegitimate person, e.g. the NSA, to decrypt the information.

%Moreover, in several scenarios it is benefical to protect only certain parts of some encrypted data. E.g., for encrypted medical data, it is useful to compute certain statistics or correlations between data elements in order to study interactions of medicaments. But this should be possible without revealing the identities of the involved patients. 

%A big open and somewhat ignored question in cryptography is whether all these operations on encrypted data can be done in a streaming model, where the encrypted data is provided as a stream rather than a randomly accessible piece of data.

\section*{Zusammenfassung}

Die Sicherheit kryptographischer Protokolle wird mittels Reduktionen auf die Sicherheit vermeintlich schwerer Probleme zurückgeführt. Solche Reduktionen transformieren einen erfolgreichen Angreifer auf ein Protokoll in einen Algorithmus für das zugrundeliegende Problem. Damit impliziert im Umkehrschluss die Schwere des Problems die Sicherheit des Protokolls. In der Vergangenheit nutzten Kryptographen klassische zahlentheoreti\-sche Probleme wie das RSA-Problem oder das Diskrete Logarithmus Problem. Diese Probleme sind allerdings leicht auf Quantenrechnern zu lösen. Aufgrund der fortschreitenden Entwicklung von Quantenrechnern hat das National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) folgerichtig im Herbst 2016 einen Aufruf zur Einreichung quanten-resistenter kryptographischer Primitiven gestartet.

Sehr wahrscheinlich wird die Mehrzahl der praktikablen Kandidaten in diesem NIST-Wettbewerb auf der Schwere von Problemen der Kodierungs- und Gittertheorie basieren, wie z.B. Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) und Learning with Errors (LWE). NIST fordert wohldefinierte Sicherheitslevel von 128, 192 und 256 Bit auf klassischen Rechnern und 64, 80, 128 Bit auf Quantenrechnern. D.h. für eine Instantiierung von LPN mit z.B. 128 Bit klassischer Sicherheit muss sichergestellt werden, dass jeder LPN-Algorithmus mindestens $2^{128}$ Schritte auf einem klassischen Rechner benötigt.
 
Da $2^{128}$ Schritte weit jenseits derzeitiger Berechnungsmöglichkeiten liegen, studiert man heutzutage typischerweise mittlere Sicherheitslevel von $50-60$ Bit in praktischen Experimenten und extrapoliert mittels asymptotischer Formeln zum gewünschten Sicherheitslevel, um vernünftige Sicherheitsaussagen zu treffen. Allerdings spielt neben der Laufzeit der Speicherbedarf bei solchen Aussagen eine herausragende Rolle. Für die interessanten Probleme LPN und LWE benötigen die heutzutage besten Algorithmen die Speicherung exponentiell vieler Samples. Diese riesigen Datenmengen und der damit verbundene Speicherbedarf machen derzeit eine Durchführung von Experimenten selbst für mittlere Sicherheitslevel unmöglich und verhindern somit eine verlässliche Vorhersage von kryptographischen Schlüssellängen.

Das folgende Projekt beschäftigt sich mit Algorithmen mit geringem Speicherbedarf für Probleme der Kodierungs- und Gittertheorie und betrachtet den Einsatz dieser quanten-resistenten Probleme in einer der fundamentalsten Anwendungen moderner Kryptographie, dem Schlüsselaustausch-Protokoll.

\section{State of the art and preliminary work}

Following the guidelines for applications we report on the state of the art as well as the PI's preliminary work. Although, technical speaking, this is \emph{not} a renewal proposal, the proposal here should continue our participation within the priority program SPP 1736~(Algorithms for Big Data). We therefore report about the achievements of our project SecOBig in the first phase of the program and the reason for discontinuing SecOBig in Section~\ref{sec:secobig}. 

\subsection{State of the art}

Big data processing in cryptography often refers to the efficiency of mounting attacks. Typically, if an adversary gets access to a sufficient amount of data and can provide enough resources, then the sought-after information becomes available. Remarkably, in most cases cryptographers focus on the time requirements of attacks in order to assess the security of solutions. Yet, the memory consumption for both storing large amounts of data and for executing attacks is an important factor, too.%
\footnote{A concrete example where this fact has been brought back to the center of attention is the (officially confirmed) initiative of the US National Security Agency (NSA) to build the so-called Utah Data Center for mass storage of data.}


\paragraph{The Impact of Memory Consumption.}
For analyzing and instantiating cryptographic systems one usually  focuses on the aspect of adversarial running time. For instance, for cryptographic reductions one usually does not care about memory requirements, such as for the storage for oracle queries and answers. The same is true for the study of the underlying hard problems. The reason is that, often, the fastest algorithm with running time $t$ also has a memory consumption of roughly $t$. 

In cryptography, however, the space requirement for an attack can be a significant factor.
%While it is in general a good idea to define cryptographic security in a conservative manner, this does not properly reflect practice. 
While performing $2^{60}$ operations today is considered to be feasible, even on a medium-sized computing cluster in a reasonable amount of time, any algorithm with RAM consumption $2^{60}$ bits will not be implementable in the near future. An Internet investigation shows that nowadays the largest supercomputers\footnote{e.g. the IBM 20-Petaflops cluster installed in Sequoia, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California} have a RAM of at most 1.6 PB $<2^{54}$ bits. If an algorithm has to use external memory, then its running time usually slows down significantly.

Hence, for estimating the security of cryptographic constructions one should also consider an upper bound on the memory consumption. This in turn defines a need for finding efficient algorithms with small memory consumption. 

\paragraph{The Impact on LPN and LWE.}
In this proposal we combine the question of memory consumption with a recent development in cryptography, due to the potential advances in quantum computing. Nowadays the question pops up which cryptography can still be considered to be suitable to protect data, since classical problems like RSA or discrete logarithms will become insecure once quantum computers reach maturity.
%
%This is even more urgent for the most prominent candidates for Post-Quantum Cryptography. 

In November 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will open a call for candidates of cryptosystems for encryption, signature and key exchange, which are presumably immune to quantum attacks. The candidates will then undergo a period of 3-5 years of cryptanalytic research, before a recommendation is made. 
Most likely, a majority of these systems will be based on problems from coding and lattice theory, such as Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). But the currently best algorithms for both problems have a memory consumption which is as large as their running time, making them useless for implemention even on medium size security levels. Let us have a closer look at LPN/LWE and their currently best algorithms. 


\paragraph{LPN and the BKW algorithm.} In LPN~\cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Alekhnovich03}, one has to find a secret $\mb s \in \F_2^n$ given access to an oracle that outputs samples of the form $(\mb a_i, b_i)$, where $\mb a_i \in_R \F_2^n$ and $b_i = \langle \mb a_i, \mb s \rangle + e_i$ for some Bernoulli error $e_i$. The algorithm of Blum, Kalai and Wasserman (BKW)~\cite{BKW} achieves the best currently known running time $t=2^{\bigO(\frac{n}{\log n})}$ for constant error, but suffers from requiring to store $t$ samples in memory. Due to its large sample complexity, there is no chance to speed up BKW quantumly, since LPN-samples are inherently classical.

\paragraph{LWE and Lattice Sieving.} LWE~\cite{Regev05} is a generalization of LPN to arbitrary fields $\F_q$. Namely, one has to find a secret $\mb s \in \F_q^n$ given access to an oracle that output samples of the form $(\mb a_i, b_i)$, where $\mb a_i \in_R \F_q^n$ and $b_i = \langle \mb a_i, \mb s \rangle + e_i$ for some discrete error $e_i$ whose distribution is centered around $0$ (e.g. a discrete Gaussian). Depending on the LWE-parameters, the best algorithm for LWE is either a generalization of BKW to $\F_q$~\cite{AlbrechtCFFP15} or lattice sieving~\cite{DBLP:conf/stoc/AggarwalDRS15}. Both algorithms achieve for cryptographic parameter settings a running time of $2^{\bigO(n)}$, consuming the same exponential amount of memory. Moreover, for both algorithms no significant speed-up via quantum search methods is known. 

\paragraph{Deployment of LPN and LWE in Key Exchange Protocols.}
Analogously to the problem of determining the necessary resources for mounting attacks, in order to make recommendations for secure choices for the underlying problems, we are interested in the security when these problems are deployed in more complex protocols.
%influence of the deployment of the problems like LWE and LPN. 
We are especially interested in securing communication data and the question how we can prevent attackers to decipher data which is stored now and potentially sifted through later, e.g., once quantum computers are available. The connection to the first part of the proposal is via the estimated hardness of potentially quantum-resistant problems such as LPN and LWE. 
%The research in that part will suggest parameter choices withstanding Big Data engineering efforts, such that we can build secure systems and recommend appropriate parameter choices. 

Securing communication data between two parties typically consists of composing a so-called key exchange protocol with a secure channel protocol.  With the secure key exchange protocol the participants establish a shared cryptographic key, which should be known only to them. Then, this key is used in a secure channel protocol to send the actual data in a confidential and authentic way. 

The focus for securing communication against advanced attacks, especially against quantum cryptanalysis, currently lies on the key exchange part. The  reason is that it is currently unclear if quantum attacks improve over classical attacks for the channel part. In contrast, most of the practically deployed key exchange protocols (such as the ones used in TLS~1.2 \cite{TLS12} and the future TLS~1.3 \cite{TLS13}) rely on number-theoretic problems which are highly amenable to quantum attacks. The best known examples are the paramount Diffie-Hellman based protocols which can be broken in polynomial time by quantum attackers.  


Concerning efforts to build quantum-resistant key exchange protocol, this area has gained quite some momentum, culminating in proposals to derive such protocols from (Ring-)LWE \cite{P14,BCNS15,ADPS16,BCDMNNRS16}. For the scheme in \cite{ADPS16}, the ``New Hope'' key exchange protocol, Google recently announced to experiment with the scheme in its Chrome browser \cite{Google}. Another recent proposal for a potentially quantum-resistant key exchange protocol is based on ideal lattices \cite{ZZDSD15}.

\paragraph{Shortcomings of current LPN-/LWE-based Key Exchange Protocols.}

Unfortunately, most of the quantum-immune key exchange candidates have at least one shortcoming. For example, the analysis of New Hope \cite{ADPS16} relies on the classical random oracle model, although it has been argued in \cite{BDFLSZ11} that quantum access to this idealized primitive should be preferred in such settings. Others, such as \cite{BCNS15,BCDMNNRS16} provide security in the ACCE notion of Jager et al.~\cite{JKSS12}, arguing security when the key exchange protocol is composed with an atomic channel. This at the moment excludes a modular analysis if instead a stream-based channel is used (as possible in TLS) \cite{FGMP15}. Moreover, all the analyses follow the classical choice of investigating primarily the run time and success probability of adversaries, mainly neglecting the memory consumption in the  reduction.


Furthermore, most of the aforementioned works  start with the unauthenticated key exchange setting, where parties and transmissions are not authenticated. They argue that this can be accomplished later by adding signatures. Here, however, it is unclear if breaking the authentication with a quantum computer afterwards could not lead to a break of current executions (since the secrets may still be in use later). Furthermore, in some cases this requires some changes to the structure, such that for example \cite{BCNS15,BCDMNNRS16} are, strictly speaking, not compatible to TLS.


Another shortcoming of the current proposals is that it they may not be easy to integrate into the upcoming TLS~1.3 protocol. While \cite{BCNS15,ADPS16,BCDMNNRS16} argue how this can be done for TLS~1.2 and provide impressive implementation and performance details, the next TLS~1.3 version adds significantly enhanced functional properties such as zero round-trip time steps. In the Diffie-Hellman setting this often necessitates to switch to other number-theoretic problems, such as the PRF-ODH assumption \cite{JKSS12}. It is unclear what this would mean for LWE- and LPN-based protocols, and if adopting a new assumption, for the memory consumption for this related problem.

\section{Objectives and work programme}

\subsection{Anticipated total duration of the project}

The total duration time of the project is 36 months (3 years). The project duration spans from the actual project begin (presumably June 2017) to 36 months later. Funding of the DFG is requested for the entire duration of 36 months.


\subsection{Objectives}

The overall goal of the project is to advance the field of memory-efficient evaluations for the cryptographic problems LWE and LPN, in order to provide sound security estimates even if  required data exceeds reasonable memory bounds. These problems are primary candidates in NIST's search for future, quantum-secure primitives. The research should be carried out for the problems itself, but also for the deployment of the problems in the important setting of key exchange. To this end the following sub goals are:
\begin{description}
%
\item[Memory Efficient Combinatorial/Lattice-Based LWE Algorithms.] We will develop combinatorial and lattice-based algorithms for LWE, both classically and quantumly, with limited memory consumption. Our goal is to precisely predict cryptographic security levels as a function of the LWE parameters $n$, $q$ and the size of the error. Therefore, we will implement our algorithms, run them on medium size instances and extrapolate asymptotically to cryptographically relevant security levels. 
%
\item[Practical Cryptanalysis of NIST's Post-Quantum Candidates.] Having combinatorial and lattice-based algorithms for tackling LWE-based cryptographic constructions, we will study the security of recent (and upcoming) proposals for the NIST initiative, such as e.g. New Hope~\cite{ADPS16} and Frodo~\cite{BCDMNNRS16}.
%
 \item[Analyses of existing LWE/LPN-based Protocols:]
  The idea is to revisit the existing protocols in light of the findings about the memory requirements for LWE and LPN. The goal is to make statements about the security bounds based on these results. This requires to check the memory consumption of the reduction and to verify if solvers for the underlying problems can be directly used in the context of key exchange, e.g., if one can ``stream'' executions of the key exchange protocol to the solver.
  %
 \item[Combining TLS~1.3 with LWE/LPN:]
 The objective here is to make LWE- and LPN-based key exchange protocols resemble the TLS~1.3 structure more closely. We expect that this will require to introduce a ``PRF-ODH like'' assumption for these problems. The goals here are thus to (a) devise protocols, (b) give a reduction to a suitable LWE- or LPN-based problem, taking the memory requirements into account, and (c) to evaluate the security of the problem in light of the analyses of the original problems in the other part of the project.

The results of the theoretical work is planned to be published at conferences, workshops, and in journals. This ensures
dissemination and availability of the project's results. In addition, we will use the usual electronic archives
like IACR's \texttt{eprint} service, and the PI's home pages to make full versions available in a lasting way.
As for experimental data, like software, we will also make these public, as part of the corresponding publication,
and through electronic archives like GitHub.

\section{Requested modules/funds}
%Explain each item for each applicant (stating last name, first name).

\subsection{Basic Module}

\subsubsection{Funding for Staff}

We apply for the following funding for staff, following the DFG's personal rates for 2016 (DFG-Vordruck 60.12). 
Due to competitive nature of positions in Computer Science and in the area of IT security, we request
funding for full doctoral student positions (100\%). We apply for funding of two doctoral
students for the entire duration of the project. One student will be associated to TU Darmstadt (TUD)
and work on packages \ref{mf:wp:eins} and \ref{mf:wp:zwei}, the other student will be associated to Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB)
and work on packages \ref{am:wp:eins} and \ref{am:wp:zwei}. Student assistents (one for each project partner) have been calculated with 10h/months
for the full duration of the project, with average costs of 11 EUR/h. They should support the implementations
in the corresponding work packages.

\subsubsection{Direct Project Costs}


%\paragraph{Equipment up to EUR 10,000, Software and Consumables.\\}
%\noindent Not requested.
%\marc{hier brauchen wir diesmal nix, oder?}
%We request an overall funding of 3,000 EUR for each applicant over the entire project duration, 6,000 EUR in total,
%to carry out experiments in Amazon's commercial Elastic MapReduce. Using Amazon's platform instead of local
%computing centers of both universities allows for an easier benchmarking and a smoother collaboration.

\paragraph{Travel Expenses.}
We apply for 8,000 Euro travel funding per year, i.e. for a total travel funding of 24,000 Euro.
This funding will cover expenses of the project partners for traveling between Darmstadt and Bochum
(500 EUR per year per partner), as well as attendances of potential  meetings of the SPP (500 EUR per year per 
partner). In addition, we calculate with 3000 EUR per year and partner for presenting the project results
at internationally renowned conferences and workshops (where we assume 1,500 EUR for an intercontinental conference, 
1,000 EUR for a European conference, and 500 EUR for a workshop attendance).

\subsection{Cooperation with other researchers}

\subsubsection*{Researchers with whom you have agreed to cooperate on this project}

%We plan to continue our cooperations with the following colleagues:

%\marc{ziemlich dumm eigentlich, dass nach uns aufzuteilen; macht keinen kollaborativen Eindruck...}


We plan to cooperate with Prof.~Dennis Hofheinz (KIT, Germany) and Prof.~Eike Kiltz (RUB, Germany) on the question of memory-efficient reductions. Prof.~Hofheinz and Prof.~Kiltz have participated in the first phase of the Priority Program 1736 (Algorithms for Big Data) jointly on a project about tight security reductions and plan to continue their collaboration in the next phase.

We also plan to cooperate with Prof.~Ulrich Meyer (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Germany) on the question whether external memory techniques can be successfully applied for the LPN/LWE scenario. Prof.~Meyer had a project on online methods in the first phase and plans to continue this project in the next phase.

I Priority Programme
For individual project proposals within an established Priority Programme, note that the fund-ing duration (part A of the proposal) and the funding periods are specified in the call for pro-posals.
For the project description (part B of the proposal) note the following:
Each proposal must be accompanied by a description of how the project is integral to the Priority Programme, both in terms of subject matter and organisation. This includes a de-scription of the cooperation with others participating within the Priority Programme. The en-visaged realisation of the project in cooperation with other applicants may be demonstrated in particular by the joint training of early career researchers, or the use of methods by multi-ple projects as part of a network.
