\section*{Summary}
%\subsection{Summary}

\alex{Muss eventuell gekürzt werden.}

The security of cryptographic primitives is related via reductions to the security of hard problems. A cryptographic security proof states that any successful adversary that breaks a cryptographic protocol $\Pi$ in time $t$ can be translated into an algorithm that breaks a hard problem in time $t'$. In order to instantiate cryptographic protocols $\Pi$ efficiently, one has to first find a tight security proof that closely links $\Pi$ to a hard problem, i.e. a reduction for which $t'$ is not much larger than $t$. Second, one has to make sure that any algorithm for the hard problem runs in time larger than $t'$. 
%This would then in turn show that there cannot be any adversary for $\pi$, since it would imply a faster algorithm for the hard problem.

In the past, cryptography relied on well studied hard problems from number-theory, such as factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in elliptic curves. However, these problems stay no longer hard in the presence of quantum computers. Therefore, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) announced in autumn 2016 a call for Post-Quantum cryptographic primitives.
%, i.e. encryption, signature and key exchange. Candidates have to be submitted by Nov 2017 and then undergo a period of 3-5 of cryptanalytic research.

Most likely, the majority of reasonable candidates will be based on hard problems from coding theory and lattices, such as Learning Parities with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). NIST requests well-defined security levels of 128, 192 and 256 bits classically, and 64, 80, 128 bits quantumly. This means that for instantiating LPN with e.g. 128 bit classical security, one has to make sure that any algorithm for LPN will need at least $2^{128}$ steps on a classical computer.

For making such a security claim in a reliable manner, one nowadays studies medium security levels of $50-60$ bits in practical experiments, and then extrapolates via asymptotic formulas to the desired security level. However, current algorithms for LPN and LWE for security level $b$ also require to store $2^b$ samples. This huge amount of data prevents to run experiments even for medium security levels, and thus prevents a reliable prediction of cryptographically secure key sizes.

The current project studies low-memory algorithms for problems in coding and lattice theory. We therefore concentrate on extracting a maximum amount of information of cryptographic oracles  in a streaming-based manner.



%Thus, we require data structures for encrypted data. In addition, we have to make sure that there do not exist any built-in backdoors for cryptography that allow an illegitimate person, e.g. the NSA, to decrypt the information.

%Moreover, in several scenarios it is benefical to protect only certain parts of some encrypted data. E.g., for encrypted medical data, it is useful to compute certain statistics or correlations between data elements in order to study interactions of medicaments. But this should be possible without revealing the identities of the involved patients. 

%A big open and somewhat ignored question in cryptography is whether all these operations on encrypted data can be done in a streaming model, where the encrypted data is provided as a stream rather than a randomly accessible piece of data.

\section{State of the art and preliminary work}

Big data processing in cryptography often refers to the efficiency of mounting attacks. Typically, if an adversary gets access to a sufficient amount of data and can provide enough resources, then the sought-after information becomes available. Remarkably, in most cases cryptographers focus on the time requirements of attacks in order to assess the security of solutions. Yet, the memory consumption for both storing large amounts of data and for executing attacks is an important factor, too.%
\footnote{A concrete example where this fact has been brought back to the center of attention is the initiative of the US National Security Agency (NSA) to build the so-called Utah Data Center for mass storage of data \cite{Utah}.}


\paragraph{The Impact of Memory Consumption.}
For analyzing and instantiating cryptographic systems one usually  focuses on the aspect of adversarial running time. For instance, for cryptographic reductions one usually does not care about memory requirements, such as for the storage for oracle queries and answers. The same is true for the study of the underlying hard problems. The reason is that, often, the fastest algorithm with running time $t$ also has a memory consumption of roughly $t$. 

In cryptography, however, the space requirement for an attack can be a significant factor.
%While it is in general a good idea to define cryptographic security in a conservative manner, this does not properly reflect practice. 
While performing $2^{60}$ operations today is considered to be feasible, even on a medium-sized computing cluster in a reasonable amount of time, any algorithm with RAM consumption $2^{60}$ bits will not be implementable in the near future. An Internet investigation shows that nowadays the largest supercomputers\footnote{e.g. the IBM 20-Petaflops cluster installed in Sequoia, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California \cite{computer}} have a RAM of at most 1.6 PB $<2^{54}$ bits. If an algorithm has to use external memory, then its running time slows down significantly.

Hence, for estimating the security of cryptographic constructions one should also consider an upper bound on the memory consumption. This in turn defines a need for finding efficient algorithms with small memory consumption. 

\paragraph{The Impact on LPN and LWE.}
In this proposal we combine the question of memory consumption with a recent development in cryptography, due to the potential advances in quantum computing. Nowadays the question pops up which cryptography can still be considered to be suitable to protect data, since classical problems like RSA or discrete logarithms will become insecure once quantum computers reach maturity.

%This is even more urgent for the most prominent candidates for Post-Quantum Cryptography. 

In November 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will open a call for candidates of cryptosystems for encryption, signature and key exchange, which are presumably immune to quantum attacks. The candidates will then undergo a period of 3-5 years of cryptanalytic research, before a recommendation is made. Most likely, a majority of these systems will be based on problems from coding and lattice theory, such as Learning Parities with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). But the currently best algorithms for both problems have a memory consumption which is as large as their running time, making them useless for implementing them even on medium size security levels.

\textbf{da geht es schon teilweise in die Forschung, muss ich nochmal trennen}

\paragraph{Deployment of LPN and LWE in Key Exchange Protocols.}
Analogously to the problem of determining the necessary resources for mounting attacks, in order to make recommendations for secure choices for the underlying problems, we are interested in the security when these problems are deployed in more complex protocols.
%influence of the deployment of the problems like LWE and LPN. 
We are especially interested in securing communication data and the question how we can prevent agencies to decipher data which is stored now and potentially sifted through later, e.g., once quantum computers are available. The connection to the first part of the proposal is via the estimated hardness of potentially quantum-resistant problems such as LPN and LWE. The research in that part will suggest parameter choices withstanding Big Data engineering efforts, such that we can build secure systems and recommend appropriate parameter choices. 

Securing communication data between two parties typically consists of composing a so-called key exchange protocol with a secure channel protocol.  With the secure key exchange protocol the participants establish a shared cryptographic key, which should be known only to them. Then, this key is used in a secure channel protocol to send the actual data in a confidential and authentic way. 

The focus for securing communication against advanced attacks, especially against quantum cryptanalysis, currently lies on the key exchange part. The reason is twofold. The first reason is that most of the practically deployed key exchange protocols (such as the ones used in TLS~1.2 \cite{} and the future TLS~1.3 \cite{}) rely on number-theoretic problems which are highly amenable to quantum attacks. The best known examples are the paramount Diffie-Hellman based protocols which can be broken in polynomial time by quantum attackers. 

\paragraph{Shortcomings of current Key Exchange Protocols}
Unfortunately, the analyses of the above protocols does not match common standards in the classical setting. Some of the analyses refer to single execution of the key exchange protocol only, as opposed to the standard multi-instance setting in, say, the Bellare-Rogaway model \cite{}. This has a major impact on the quantity of the security guarantees.
Moreover, the analyses follow the classical choice of investigating primarily the run time and success probability of adversaries, mainly neglecting the memory consumption.

The other aspect is that the protocol analyses neglect the authentication problem. That is, they usually work in the unuathenticated setting and argue that authentication can be added via classically secure signature schemes. Indeed, Bos et al.~\cite{BCDMNNRS16} state that
\begin{quote}
``the secrecy of today's communications can be compromised by a quantum computer that is built decades into the future (by an attacker who stores these communications until then); on the other hand, authentication can only be forged at connection time.''
\end{quote}
Here, however, it is unclear if breaking the authentication with a quantum computer afterwards could not lead to a break of current executions (since the secrets may still be in use later).

Another shortcoming of the current proposals is that it they may not be easy to integrate into the upcoming TLS~1.3 protocol. While \cite{BCNS15,ADPS16,BCDMNNRS16} argue how this can be done for TLS~1.2 and provide impressive implementation and performance details, the next TLS~1.3 version adds significantly enhanced functional properties such as zero round-trip time steps. It is currently unclear how

\section{Objectives and work programme}

\subsection{Anticipated total duration of the project}

The total duration time of the project is 36 months (3 years). The project duration spans from the actual project begin
(presumably June 2014) to 36 months later. Funding of the DFG is requested for the entire duration of 36 months.


\subsection{Objectives}

The overall goal of the project is to advance the field of cryptographically-protected processing of big data by
proposing new cryptographic solutions which match the requirements of this scenario, and by supporting an easy 
integration of the solutions into the MapReduce framework. To this end the following sub goals should be addressed:
\begin{description}
 \item[Fundamental Operations for Encrypted Data:]
 The first sub goal is to provide tailor-made solutions for a quite large set of operations, in order
 to preserve privacy. The starting set are relational operations such as union, projection, and intersection. Here
 the problem is to deal with duplicates (which need to be removed for union and projection), relating to the 
 deduplication problem for encrypted cloud storage \cite{dedup}. We also investigate problems related to 
 basic problems such as ``grepping'' and graph algorithms like PageRank (see \cite{LD10}), aiming to exploit special encryption
 schemes like deterministic encryption for performance.
% machine learning,
% in particular, how to implement operations based on computing Euclidean distances such as $k$-means or
% Locally Weighted Linear Regression \cite{ml}. 
Prototypes will be implemented and tested in MapReduce.
 
 \item[Fundamental Operations for Authenticated Data:]
 This part of the project shall design digital signature schemes and message authentication scheme which are 
 compatible with known MapReduce applications. As explained, general solutions for the authentication problem
 are still missing ---unlike for the case of encryption--- such that we first aim at specific solutions.
 Our goal is to provide efficient authentication solutions in order to combine them with the
 specific solutions for encryption in the aforementioned case. Since some cases like grepping should be easy,
 our goal is also to investigate some problems related to machine learning,
 in particular, how to implement operations based on computing Euclidean distances such as $k$-means or
 Locally Weighted Linear Regression \cite{ml}. 
   Again, solutions will be integrated and tested into 
 MapReduce.
 
\item[Feasibility of outsourced computation on encrypted data:] 
While the previous sub goals aim at specific problems, another goal is to provide general solutions.
Hence, based on the framework of functional encryption identify functionalities which can be efficiently realized on encrypted data in a cloud/outsourced computing scenario. Implement and test those functionalities in MapReduce. 

\item[Cryptography in the streaming model:] Transfer known cryptographic security notions to a streaming/highly parallelized model, where one does not have random access to the whole data. Moreover, the restriction is to (approximately) extract useful information in sublinear/polylogarithmic running time with very limited storage. To test our algorithms, we will choose as a framework Google's MapReduce. 

\item[Enhance cryptographic certification properties:] 
Since cryptographic means seem to be the only solution for protecting our privacy against security agencies/industrial espionage, we have to make sure that cryptography is designed in a way that does not offer any backdoors by publicly verifiable process. It is important that this certification is compatible with existing cryptographic infrastructure, i.e. that it does not require to renew all existing keys.

\end{description}

Besides the scientific advancements we expect our result of be of social and political importance in light of the recent 
revelations around the NSA affair.

\subsubsection{Work package A.1: Fundamental Operations on Encrypted Data}

To achieve the goal of designing efficient solutions for the basic problems for 
union, projection, and intersection, and the text-based and graph-based problems we
investigate the potential of deterministic encryption \cite{BBN07}. Informally,
deterministic encryption ensures that each message has a unique ciphertext, supporting
equality checks straightforwardly, but such that basically nothing else about ciphertexts is leaked. 
The disadvantage is, however, that the message needs to be highly entropic in order to guarantee
security. 

The entropy requirement infringes with basic operations like grepping expressions in a large file. The reason
is that we cannot individually encrypt short chunks of the file and uphold confidentiality, as the entropy
guarantees may be to given anymore for short parts. The same holds for other operations like computing
the intersection. Hence, new ways to use deterministic encryption must be found. The approach we plan to investigate
is to combine deterministic encryption with a mild form of homomorphic encryption. We may
extract a cryptographic key $k$ from the big data (with high entropy), pseudorandomly derive keys $k_1,k_2,\dots$
for each chunk of the data, and then encrypt deterministically the chunks of the data, where we append the corresponding 
key to the data chunk. To search within a chunk one encrypts the key word and the starting key $k_1$ and then
``moves'' (and homomorphically updates!) this ciphertext across the chunks.
The challenge here is to find a deterministic encryption scheme and a pseudorandom generator which are 
compatible and allow to update. Here the scheme by Boldyreva et al.~\cite{BSN08} serves as our starting point,
but if necessary we may also investigate the potential of fully homomorphic encryption instead.

For the intersection and the similar relational task we may use similar ideas, although here different problems arise
due to the requirement to remove duplicates. This is also known as the deduplication problem in cloud storage \cite{dedup}.
Some solutions have been presented in \cite{dedup,dedup2}. We plan to investigate how to improve these solutions,
especially in light of incrementality, i.e., to compute solutions faster if the data is updated only slightly, and
to incorporate them into the MapReduce Framework. The final step in this work package is to investigate
the possibility to derive tailored solutions for graph-based problems, where PageRank serves as an entry point.


\subsubsection{Work Package A.2: Fundamental Operations for Authenticated Data}

In this work package we provide solutions for processing big data authentically. As mentioned before, 
since currently the development of omnipotent authentication methods lacks behind, compared to fully homomorphic
encryption, and the goal of this project is to make cryptographic methods applicable to MapReduce, our work
here focuses on designing specific solutions for concrete problems. The solutions should be combined with
the construction of work package A.1.

As a first step we will investigate
the applicability of known homomorphic signature schemes like \cite{P2EC:BonFre11,P2PKC:Freeman12,P2PKC:CatFioWar12}
to the basic relational problems like aggregation; problems like intersection at first glance seem to be straightforward.
For the graph-based problems like PageRank we will first explore the ability to use transitive signatures \cite{P2RSA:MicRiv02b}. 
We expect that this will not be applicable in all cases, such that we will develop new signature schemes if necessary.
For the applications from machine learning like Euclidean distances such as $k$-means or
 Locally Weighted Linear Regression we definitely need to devise new schemes. Our starting point will be schemes
 for related problems. All solutions will be matched to MapReduce, of course.

\subsubsection{Work Package B.1: Feasibility of Outsourced computation on encrypted data}
The starting point of our work programme in this package is the recent work of Garg et al~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/Garg13} that shows how to realize functional encryption. This notion is tightly connected to the {\em obfuscation} of programs. Roughly speaking, obfuscation of a program means that the program preserves its functionality while becoming unintelligible to the outside. It was known for more than 10 years that so-called black-box obfuscation is  impossible~\cite{DBLP:journals/eccc/ECCC-TR01-057}, however a weaker notion called indistinguishable obfuscation is possible for any polynomial-size circuit.

Surprisingly, this weaker notion is already sufficient to achieve {\em functional encryption}, i.e. to allow a key holder to learn a well-specified function of the encrypted data but nothing else. The construction uses a simplification of so-called multi-linear maps~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/GargGH13}.
The work of Garg et al.~immediately raises some open questions that we would like to address.
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploit the power of {\em indistinguishable obfuscation}: It comes quite at a surprise that indistinguishable obfuscation is actually enough to realize functional encryption. Given this, what else can be achieved with this notion?
\item Weaken the complexity assumptions: The construction of {\em indistinguishable obfuscation} requires a heuristic complexity assumption. The question is whether this notion can be achieved by a cryptographic standard assumption.
\item Improve on Efficiency: Our goal in the project is to realize functionalities that are interesting to compute on big data (e.g. computing statistics). Which functionalities can be realized especially fast. Can we improve on efficiency by restricting on a limited class of functionalities. How fast is the realization when implemented?
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Work Package B.2: Enhance cryptographic certification properties}
If the cryptographic realizations of other Work Packages of B.1 are applied in a large scale for big data applications, it is mandatory that users can rely on a guarantee that their data's integrity, confidentiality and privacy are protected. Of course, cryptographic security proofs guarantee this for any efficient adversary, albeit {\em only if the schemes are implemented in a way as originally specified}. E.g. almost all cryptographic heavily rely on (pseudo)randomness in a very strong sense. Namely, the security guarantees might completely collapse if the used bits provide for instance some bias.

Thus in order to guarantee a wide-spread acceptance of cryptography for highly sensitive big data, like medical information, it is mandatory to define ``proofs'' that show that the cryptography was used in a sense as specified. We will proceed in the formalization of these proofs/certification as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Define a way that formalizes the notion of proof/certification of a cryptographic scheme. Can this only be defined interactively, i.e. does it require a protocol between a prover and a verifier? If yes, how many rounds of interaction do we need in such protocol? If no, how short are the proofs and how efficiently can they be generated and checked?
\item Which functionalities of a cryptographic scheme can easily be certified? Which ones are hard/impossible to certify? Notice that there must be impossibility results, since certification in its strongest sense provides an equivalence test for two Turing machines, a problem that is known to be undecidable  in general. On the positive side, we already showed in our preliminary work that interesting properties can be certified efficiently.
\item Which cryptographic schemes allow for an easy embedding of backdoors that enable somebody to decrypt without a secret key? Is there a general tranformation that embeds a trapdoor into a scheme in an oblivious manner? Or is it possible to construct {\em backdoor-free cryptography} in the sense that any scheme that includes a backdoor can be easily detected. 	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Work Package C.1: Cryptography in the streaming model}

Building on the work in Packages A.1, B.1, and B.2 we plan to study which functionalities can be achieved within some approximation ratio 
in sublinear time in the encrypted domain. Notice that we are not allowed to decrypted in order to apply standard 
non-cryptographic solutions to the problem. We would like to stress that such a setting has not been studied in the cryptographic community so far. Hence we have to start from scratch and will proceed in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define a proper cryptographic model that serves as an analogue of the classical streaming model. Study and adapt classical security notions such as indistinguishability of encryptions under CPA/CCA-attacks in the new model. A cryptographic scheme by definition always satisfies two properties, its functionality and the security in a well-defined setting (for any polynomial time adversary). Here, we first start with the security property. We take related notions like on-line encryption \cite{online} into account.
\item Which of the interesting functionalities of classical streaming algorithms like e.g. heavy hitters, frequency moments or entropy can be transferred to algorithms in the encrypted domain? How does the performance suffer from restricting on encrypted data?
\item Which of the efficiently realizable functionalities from Project B.1 transfers to the streaming world? How does the approximation guarantee suffer from the streaming model? Classify which functionalities in the encrypted domain are especially suited towards streaming.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data handling}

The results of the theoretical work is planned to be published at conferences, workshops, and in journals. This ensures
dissemination and availability of the project's results. In addition, we will use the usual electronic archives
like IACR's \texttt{eprint} service, and the PI's home pages to make full versions available in a lasting way.
As for experimental data, like software, we will also make these public, as part of the corresponding publication,
and through electronic archives.

\section{Requested modules/funds}
%Explain each item for each applicant (stating last name, first name).

\subsection{Basic Module}

\subsubsection{Funding for Staff}

We apply for the following funding for staff, following the DFG's personal rates for 2013 (DFG-Vordruck 60.12). 
Due to competitive nature of positions in Computer Science and in the area of IT security, we request
funding for full doctoral student positions (100\%). We apply for funding of two doctoral
students for the entire duration of the project. One student will be associated to TU Darmstadt (TUD)
and work on packages A.1, A.2, and C.1, the other student will be associated to Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB)
and work on packages B.1, B.2, and C.1. Student Assistents (one for each project partner) have been calculated with 10h/months
for the full duration of the project, with average costs of 11 EUR/h. They should support the implementations
in the corresponding work packages.

%We apply for a 3-year funding period of all positions, starting in June 2014.\\


\subsubsection{Direct Project Costs}


\paragraph{Equipment up to EUR 10,000, Software and Consumables.}
We request an overall funding of 3,000 EUR for each applicant over the entire project duration, 6,000 EUR in total,
to carry out experiments in Amazon's commercial Elastic MapReduce. Using Amazon's platform instead of local
computing centers of both universities allows for an easier benchmarking and a smoother collaboration.

\paragraph{Travel Expenses.}
We apply for 8,000 Euro travel funding per year, i.e. for a total travel funding of 24,000 Euro.
This funding will cover expenses of the project partners for traveling between Darmstadt and Bochum
(500 EUR per year per partner), as well as attendances of potential  meetings of the SPP (500 EUR per year per 
partner). In addition, we calculate with 3000 EUR per year and partner for presenting the project results
at internationally renowned conferences and workshops (where we assume 1,500 EUR for an intercontinental conference, 
1,000 EUR for a European conference, and 500 EUR for a workshop attendance).

I Priority Programme
For individual project proposals within an established Priority Programme, note that the fund-ing duration (part A of the proposal) and the funding periods are specified in the call for pro-posals.
For the project description (part B of the proposal) note the following:
Each proposal must be accompanied by a description of how the project is integral to the Priority Programme, both in terms of subject matter and organisation. This includes a de-scription of the cooperation with others participating within the Priority Programme. The en-visaged realisation of the project in cooperation with other applicants may be demonstrated in particular by the joint training of early career researchers, or the use of methods by multi-ple projects as part of a network.
