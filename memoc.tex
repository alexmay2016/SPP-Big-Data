\section*{Summary}
%\subsection{Summary}

\alex{Muss eventuell gekürzt werden.}

The security of cryptographic primitives is related via reductions to the security of hard problems. A cryptographic security proof states that any successful adversary that breaks a cryptographic protocol $\Pi$ in time $t$ can be translated into an algorithm that breaks a hard problem in time $t'$. In order to instantiate cryptographic protocols $\Pi$ efficiently, one has to first find a tight security proof that closely links $\Pi$ to a hard problem, i.e. a reduction for which $t'$ is not much larger than $t$. Second, one has to make sure that any algorithm for the hard problem runs in time larger than $t'$. 
%This would then in turn show that there cannot be any adversary for $\pi$, since it would imply a faster algorithm for the hard problem.

In the past, cryptography relied on well studied hard problems from number-theory, such as factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in elliptic curves. However, these problems stay no longer hard in the presence of quantum computers. Therefore, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) announced in autumn 2016 a call for Post-Quantum cryptographic primitives.
%, i.e. encryption, signature and key exchange. Candidates have to be submitted by Nov 2017 and then undergo a period of 3-5 of cryptanalytic research.

Most likely, the majority of reasonable candidates will be based on hard problems from coding theory and lattices, such as Learning Parities with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). NIST requests well-defined security levels of 128, 192 and 256 bits classically, and 64, 80, 128 bits quantumly. This means that for instantiating LPN with e.g. 128 bit classical security, one has to make sure that any algorithm for LPN will need at least $2^{128}$ steps on a classical computer.

For making such a security claim in a reliable manner, one nowadays studies medium security levels of $50-60$ bits in practical experiments, and then extrapolates via asymptotic formulas to the desired security level. However, current algorithms for LPN and LWE for security level $b$ also require to store $2^b$ samples. This huge amount of data prevents to run experiments even for medium security levels, and thus prevents a reliable prediction of cryptographically secure key sizes.

The current project studies low-memory algorithms for problems in coding and lattice theory. We therefore concentrate on extracting a maximum amount of information of cryptographic oracles  in a streaming-based manner.



%Thus, we require data structures for encrypted data. In addition, we have to make sure that there do not exist any built-in backdoors for cryptography that allow an illegitimate person, e.g. the NSA, to decrypt the information.

%Moreover, in several scenarios it is benefical to protect only certain parts of some encrypted data. E.g., for encrypted medical data, it is useful to compute certain statistics or correlations between data elements in order to study interactions of medicaments. But this should be possible without revealing the identities of the involved patients. 

%A big open and somewhat ignored question in cryptography is whether all these operations on encrypted data can be done in a streaming model, where the encrypted data is provided as a stream rather than a randomly accessible piece of data.

\section{State of the art and preliminary work}

In analyzing and instantiating cryptographic systems, one usually solely focus on time. For instance, for cryptographic reductions one does not care about the storage for oracle queries. The same is true for the study of the underlying hard problems, where often for the fastest algorithm with running time $t$, we also have a memory consumption of $t$.

While it is in general a good idea to define cryptographic security in a conservative manner, this does not properly reflect practice. While caring out $2^{60}$ operations is feasible on a medium-sized computing cluster in a reasonable amount of time, any algorithm with RAM consumption $2^{60}$ bits will not be implementable in the near future. An Internet investigation shows that nowadays the largest supercomputers\footnote{e.g. the IBM 20-Petaflops cluster installed in Sequoia, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California \cite{computer}} have a RAM of at most 1.6 PB $<2^{54}$ bits. If an algorithm has to use external memory, then its running time explodes.

Hence, for estimating the security of cryptographic constructions one should settle an upper bound on the memory consumption. This in turn defines a need for finding efficient algorithms with small memory consumption. This is even more urgent for the most prominent candidates for Post-Quantum Cryptography. 

In Nov 2017, NIST will choose several cryptosystems for encryption, signature and key exchange that will then undergo a period of 3-5 of cryptanalytic research. Most likely, a majority of these systems will be based on problems from coding and lattice theory, such as Learning Parities with Noise (LPN) and Learning with Errors (LWE). But the currently best algorithms for both problems have a memory consumption which is as large as their running time, making them useless for implementing them even on medium size security levels.

\subsubsection{Funding for Staff}

We apply for the following funding for staff, following the DFG's personal rates for 2016 (DFG-Vordruck 60.12). 
Due to competitive nature of positions in Computer Science and in the area of IT security, we request
funding for full doctoral student positions (100\%). We apply for funding of two doctoral
students for the entire duration of the project. One student will be associated to TU Darmstadt (TUD)
and work on packages B.1, B.2, and C.1, the other student will be associated to Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB)
and work on packages A.1, A.2, and C.1. Student Assistents (one for each project partner) have been calculated with 10h/months
for the full duration of the project, with average costs of 11 EUR/h. They should support the implementations
in the corresponding work packages.

\subsubsection{Direct Project Costs}


\paragraph{Equipment up to EUR 10,000, Software and Consumables.}
We request an overall funding of 3,000 EUR for each applicant over the entire project duration, 6,000 EUR in total,
to carry out experiments in Amazon's commercial Elastic MapReduce. Using Amazon's platform instead of local
computing centers of both universities allows for an easier benchmarking and a smoother collaboration.

\paragraph{Travel Expenses.}
We apply for 8,000 Euro travel funding per year, i.e. for a total travel funding of 24,000 Euro.
This funding will cover expenses of the project partners for traveling between Darmstadt and Bochum
(500 EUR per year per partner), as well as attendances of potential  meetings of the SPP (500 EUR per year per 
partner). In addition, we calculate with 3000 EUR per year and partner for presenting the project results
at internationally renowned conferences and workshops (where we assume 1,500 EUR for an intercontinental conference, 
1,000 EUR for a European conference, and 500 EUR for a workshop attendance).

I Priority Programme
For individual project proposals within an established Priority Programme, note that the fund-ing duration (part A of the proposal) and the funding periods are specified in the call for pro-posals.
For the project description (part B of the proposal) note the following:
Each proposal must be accompanied by a description of how the project is integral to the Priority Programme, both in terms of subject matter and organisation. This includes a de-scription of the cooperation with others participating within the Priority Programme. The en-visaged realisation of the project in cooperation with other applicants may be demonstrated in particular by the joint training of early career researchers, or the use of methods by multi-ple projects as part of a network.
