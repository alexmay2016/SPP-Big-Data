\paragraph{Memory-efficient LPN algorithm.} We have extensive expertise on design algorithms for decoding random binary linear codes~\cite{Codes11,Codes12,Codes15}. LPN  can be seen as a decoding problem in a random binary linear code generated by the LPN sample vectors $\mb a_i$. As opposed to classical decoding problem, in LPN one can freely choose the length of the code via the number of LPN samples.

We already have a preliminary paper that proposes new LPN algorithm, both classically and also for the first time quantumly~\cite{LPN}.  Based on our methods for decoding random binary linear codes, especially the algorithm of May, Meurer, Thomae~\cite{Codes11}. The preliminary work is currently under submission, and is attached as supplementary material to this project proposal.

\paragraph{Asymptotic Complexity Analysis of LWE.} We also extensively studied already the complexity of existing algorithms for solving LWE concerning the metrics time, memory and number of samples. Our work~\cite{LWE} summarizes the state of the art and identifies the best algorithms for specific choices of the LWE parameters $n$, $q$ and the error distribution. However, all these algorithms suffer from their huge memory consumption, making them an inadequate choice for establishing secure LWE parameters in practice.
