\paragraph{Memory-efficient LPN algorithm.} We have extensive expertise on the design of algorithms for decoding random binary linear codes~\cite{Codes11,Codes12,Codes15}. LPN  can be seen as a decoding problem in a random binary linear code generated by the LPN sample vectors $\mb a_i$, where the $b_i$ represent the erroneous codeword. %As opposed to classical decoding problems, in LPN one can freely choose the length of the code via the number of LPN samples.

We already have a preliminary paper that proposes new memory-efficient LPN algorithms~\cite{LPN}, both classically and also for the first time quantumly.  This work is based on our methods for decoding random binary linear codes, especially the May-Meurer-Thomae algorithm~\cite{Codes11}. The preliminary paper~\cite{LPN} is currently under submission, and is attached as supplementary material to this project proposal.

\paragraph{Asymptotic Complexity Analysis of LWE.} We also studied already the asymptotic complexity of existing algorithms for solving LWE concerning the metrics time, memory and number of samples. Our work~\cite{LWE} summarizes the state of the art and identifies the best algorithms for specific choices of the LWE parameters $n$, $q$ and the error distribution. However, all the algorithms in~\cite{LWE} suffer from their huge memory consumption, making them an inadequate choice for establishing secure LWE parameters in practice.
