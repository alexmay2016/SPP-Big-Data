\paragraph{Key Exchange.}
We have extensively contributed to fundamental question about key exchange models \cite{BFWW11,FG14}, dealing with composability and multi-stage key exchange protocols. We have provided analyses of the (Diffie-Hellman based) TLS protocols \cite{BFSWW13,DFGS15}, both for versions 1.2 and the (candidates for) 1.3. We have also investigated the special modes and properties of the candidates for TLS version 1.3~\cite{DFGS15,FGSW16}.

\paragraph{Cryptographic Reductions.}
Since our research area is complexity-based cryptography, reductions are our main tool in conducting security proofs of cryptographic protocols and appear in the majority of our works. Concerning reductions themselves we have extensive expertise about notions of reductions \cite{F12,BBF13}. All the aforementioned works about key exchange involve reductions in the domain of key exchange.
